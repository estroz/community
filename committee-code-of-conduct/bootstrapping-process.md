# Bootstrapping Document for Operator Framework Code of Conduct Committee

This document, created by the Operator Framework community chairs, outlines the creation process, mission, and scope of the Code of Conduct Commitee (CoCC).

## Objectives of the CoCC

* Maintain the Code of Conduct (CoC) document and iterate as needed.
  * All CoC revisions must be approved by the community chairs.
  * Currently, we use the CNCF CoC. Any addendums or changes based off learnings in the Operator Framework community should be owned by this body of people, the Operator Framework Code of Conduct Committee (CoCC).
* Determine and make transparent how CoC issues and incidents are reported and handled in the community.
* Enforce the Code of Conduct within the Operator Framework community.
  * Discuss with parties affected
  * Come up with resolution
  * For moderation on a day-to-day basis, work with the existing community-management subproject under SIG Contributor Experience
* Figure out how to keep a record of CoC reports and outcomes for precedent <!-- TODO: discuss -->

## Formation of the Code of Conduct Committee (CoCC)

* The CoCC consists of 5 members. In the first election, the top 3 voted people will be appointed 2 year terms and the other 2 members will be appointed for a 1 year term.
  * CoCC members appointed for a 1 year term may be elected again the following year.
  * The community chairs are eligible to nominate people for the Code of Conduct Committee (CoCC). <!-- TODO: discuss -->
  * The community chairs votes on nominees for the CoCC
* Characteristics and Guidance for nominating people for the CoCC:
  * Do not have to be part of the Operator Framework or CNCF community
  * Previous experience on an Ethics Committee or Code of Conduct Committee is appreciated
  * Has demonstrated integrity, professionalism, and positive influence within the community
  * Experience with the tools which we use to communicate (Zoom, Slack, GitHub, etc.) within the Operator Framework community is appreciated
* The members of the Code of Conduct Committee (CoCC) will be public so the people who report CoC issues know exactly who they are working with.

## CoCC Duties

* Review the current Code of Conduct and propose revisions or addendums if necessary.
  * There is already work being done around making the CoC more enforceable, so this work will be carried forward in the CoCC.
* Add an addendum to the CoC with instructions on how to contact the CoCC
* Be briefed on past and current code of conduct issues within the Operator Framework community by people who have been dealing with these issues thus far
* Revisit how code of conduct issues are reported and escalated and ensure these processes are visible and known to the community
* Determine how they envision their process going forward. The community chairs will make the recommendation to the Code of Conduct Committee that they have a standing hour long meeting every other week for the first twelve months after they are appointed, but the CoCC can figure out what works for them.
